TRAVEL BUCKET LIST

Build an app to track someone's travel adventures.


- This was my first solo project during CodeClan. I built a full stack web application Created using Python, Flask and SQL.



MVP:
The app should allow the user to track countries and cities they want to visit and those they have visited.
The user should be able to create and edit countries
Each country should have one or more cities to visit
The user should be able to create and delete entries for cities
The app should allow the user to mark destinations as visited or still to see



Functionality:

I used drop down select boxes for users to select from a list of countries.The Data in the dropdown was populated by the relavant data pulled form the database.

The user was also able to complete a form to input a new city or countries into the database.


What I learned:

I learned how important the planning stage of any project is.Time management and prioritising tasks is so important  especially when working to time constraints.
I practiced the method of the 3 B's when requireing help. Book,Buddy,Boss. I searched a lot of my errors and bugs online and would reach out to my classmates if I could not find a solution.



Extentions : 

The Styling in the app is very basic and I am constantly trying to imporve my CSS skills and will keep coming back to the app to make the look and feel of it better over time.
